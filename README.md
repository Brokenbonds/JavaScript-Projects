# Introduction
<br />
This is a folder where I will place all my JavaScript and jQuery Projects<br>

#Project 1 Expression Alert App<br>

Here I created an alert window

#Project 2 functions<br>

By clicking a button it uses a function that returns 2 concatenated strings variables together 

#Project 3 Math operators<br>

Here I go through math operators such as ```+ - * / %``` and more to figure out their uses. 

#Project 4 Dictionaries <br>

I create a couple of dictionaries, when a button is clicked it calls one and searches for a particular key for that dictionary and outputs the value.

#Project 5 Comparisons type coercision<br>

Explored many things in this Project such as the use of ```document.write();```, ```typeof``` operator and its use in concatenating a number to a string. I explored Boolean logic as well as the ```onclick``` tag in HTML. Also touched on sending messages to the console using the ```console.log``` function.

#Project 6 ternary operators constructors<br>

In this project I used the ternary operator ```?``` and create Object constructor functions

#Project 7 Scope Time Function<br>

used the ```Date()``` function to grab the hours and the minutes and output the time. Learned about the scope of variables and global variables as well as creating a function that checked an input value to see if it is bigger than 10.

#Project 8 String Method<br>

A deepr dive into strings varriables and different functions such as ```.toUpperCase()``` and ```slice()```. Also used ```to.String()``` to turn a number into a string.

#Project 9 Countdown Slideshow<br>

Created a Slide show with images, A countdown timer and figured out a shortened version using an id and ```.innerHTML``` to output a string

#Project 10 Loops Array<br>

played around with ```While()``` true loops, ```For()``` Loops, ```Arrays[]```  and learned the difference between a variable and a constant.

#Project 11 TicTacToe<br>

Created a Tic-Tac-Toe Game.

#Project 12 Calculator<br>

Created a working calculator

#Project 13 Pizza_ Project<br>

Created a mock pizza ordering webpage that calculated the cost of a pizza and its toppings.


# Project14 jQuery<br>
This is my first time using jQuery, here we introduced how to load the library, I then utilized jQuery to append our body element holding only a few paragraphs. I also used the ```.click()``` event and the ```.show()``` and ```.hide()``` effects which helped me understand how quickly I can create functionality in my webpage.

#Project 15 ToDo App<br>

This is a list app, here you can type in text that will be added to a list. When added a button will show up on the right side of the list item which can be used to delete that list time.
