# Introduction

This is a folder where I will place all my JavaScript and jQuery Projects<br>


# Project14 jQuery<br>
This is my first time using jQuery, here we introduced how to load the library, I then utilized jQuery to append our body element holding only a few paragraphs. I also used the ```.click()``` event and the ```.show()``` and ```.hide()``` effects which helped me understand how quickly I can create functionality in my webpage.
